localizationScripts/:

maskingScripts/:
Seems like set of core HMAX code with some masking variation, used in older simulaitons for data in /annulusExpt/ folder, so before the issue with face contrasts was discovered and we moved to /annulusExptFixedContrast/. Code is probably fine to delete.

patchPixelRecreation/:

scratchFunScripts/:

statistical_analysis_scripts/:

utils/:
various helper scripts as well as old scripts used with quad-simulations when we used to split up the image into four quadrants and see if the patch hit the correct quadrant.
