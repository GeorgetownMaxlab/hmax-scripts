These scripts were used so simulation 3 and 4, when we were trying to split up existing faces and background images such that we created a training and testing set of images for efficient cross-validation of our patches.

These scripts are too rigid to be re-used. They were mostly manually run with various parameters, through commenting and uncommenting of blocks of code.

Most of these scripts still have description of their function so see inside.
